			<p>
				I was always drawn to technology as a kid. The internet was a whole
				different universe that I explored and learned to love. It's knowledge
				at your fingertips.
            </p>
            <h2>What Can I Do For You?</h2>

			<p>
				I can produce outstanding quality websites that look professional, draw
				people in, and are responsive on all devices. I love working with and
				learning new technologies. I have a lot of experience with wordpress and
				building websites. I can either build a website from scratch or use a
				content management system like wordpress. Wordpress would allow you to
				easily access and change things on the site and I could customize the
				site further by editing the code of the site. I would be happy to work
				on this project for you and am looking forward to hearing back from you.
            </p>
